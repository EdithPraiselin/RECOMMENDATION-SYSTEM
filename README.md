**DESCRIPTION**: This project builds a Movie Recommendation System using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques on the MovieLens 20M dataset. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is implemented to predict user ratings for unseen movies and generate personalized recommendations. The model is optimized and performance is evaluated using RMSE and MAE. To enhance accuracy, movies with fewer than 10 ratings are filtered out to address the cold-start problem. The system suggests Top-N movie recommendations for users based on their past interactions.
